# DevOps
A guide for getting started in DevOps tools. 

[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is a free and open source automation server. Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery.

[Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo) is a continuous integration (CI) server that can be used to automate the release management for a software application, creating a continuous delivery pipeline.

[Drone CI](https://drone.io/) is a Continuous Delivery system built on container technology. Drone uses a simple YAML configuration file, a superset of docker-compose, to define and execute Pipelines inside Docker containers.

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a hosted continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub.

[Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery platform that helps software teams work smarter, faster.

[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/?nav=min) is a set of services for teams to share code, track work, and ship software; CLIs Build, deploy, diagnose, and manage multi-platform, scalable apps and services; Azure Pipelines Continuously build, test, and deploy to any platform and cloud; Azure Lab Services Set up labs for classrooms, trials, development and testing, and other scenarios

[Team City](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) is a build management and continuous integration server from JetBrains.

[AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. With CodeBuild, you don't need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers.

[Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) is a free (open source) automated testing suite for web applications across different browsers and platforms. 

[Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) is a tool based on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework which is used to write acceptance tests for the web application. It allows automation of functional validation in easily readable and understandable format (like plain English) to Business Analysts, Developers, and Testers.

[JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language.

[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) is a JavaScript test framework for Node.js programs, featuring browser support, asynchronous testing, test coverage reports, and use of any assertion library.

[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) is a simple tool that allows you to execute JavaScript code in multiple real browsers.

[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) is an open source testing framework for JavaScript. It aims to run on any JavaScript-enabled platform, to not intrude on the application nor the IDE, and to have easy-to-read syntax.

[Chef](https://www.chef.io/) is an effortless Infrastructure Suite offers visibility into security and compliance status across all infrastructure and makes it easy to detect and correct issues long before they reach production.

[Puppet](https://puppet.com/) is an open source tool that makes continuous integration and delivery of your software on traditional or containerized infrastructure easy by pulling together all your existing tools and giving you flexibility to deploy your way. 

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows.

[Salt](https://www.saltstack.com/) is Python-based, open-source software for event-driven IT automation, remote task execution, and configuration management. Supporting the "Infrastructure as Code" approach to data center system and network deployment and management, configuration automation, SecOps orchestration, vulnerability remediation, and hybrid cloud control. 

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp.It enables users to define and provision a datacenter infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.

[Packer](https://www.packer.io/) is lightweight, runs on every major operating system, and is highly performant, creating machine images for multiple platforms in parallel. Packer does not replace configuration management like Chef or Puppet. In fact, when building images, Packer is able to use tools like Chef or Puppet to install software onto the image.

[CFEngine](https://cfengine.com/) is an open-source configuration management system, written by Mark Burgess.Its primary function is to provide automated configuration and maintenance of large-scale computer systems, including the unified management of servers, desktops, consumer and industrial devices, embedded networked devices, mobile smartphones, and tablet computers.

[Octpus Deploy](https://octopus.com/) is the deployment automation server for your entire team, designed to make it easy to orchestrate releases and deploy applications, whether on-premises or in the cloud.
