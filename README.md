A guide for getting started in DevOps tools.

[Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo) is a continuous integration (CI) server that can be used to automate the release management for a software application, creating a continuous delivery pipeline.

[Drone CI](https://drone.io/) is a Continuous Delivery system built on container technology. Drone uses a simple YAML configuration file, a superset of docker-compose, to define and execute Pipelines inside Docker containers.

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a hosted continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub.

[Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery platform that helps software teams work smarter, faster.
